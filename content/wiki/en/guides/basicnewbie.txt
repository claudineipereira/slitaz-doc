<h2 id="daily-used-linux-commands">Daily used Linux commands</h2>

<p>
After starting our SliTaz base [here|en/guides/newbie#training] 
we logged on and can see now, following a Welcome message, a short 
command line prompt:
</p>

<pre>tux@dolilive:~$ _</pre>

<p>
Now we can immediately start to understand who is doing what: 
</p>

<ul>
<li>**tux**, is my login name</li>
<li>**@**, is where I am “at”</li>
<li>**dolilive**, something <em>like do_Linux_live</em></li>
<li>**:**, what we chose to do is awaiting us at the prompt and it will 
be actived here (in absence of some concrete object that would redefine
the destination)</li>
<li>**~**, is my «home» (**~** is the symbol for the home directory of 
the user logged in!)</li>
</ul>


<p>
<div class="notewarning">warning: **~** depends on the administrative 
rights you actually have</div>
</p>

<p>
If you are <em>root</em>, any data will be automatically registered in 
the special directory <em>/root</em>. The tree of the main directory is 
also named the <em>root of the file system</em>. The symbol / is the 
first sign that you see alone or in the first place of all the other
paths! It is not possible to unbind the <em>root of the file system</em>
and the main directory <em>root</em> is used by the administrator 
<em>root</em> for all of their transactions! This directory
<em>/root</em> is a special directory as for example as it has to be in 
the same partition as the tree of main directories as well as hold the 
contents of the first level! 
</p>

<p>
The <em>home</em> of users is a subdirectory in the main directory
<em>/home</em>! The path is as follows:
</p>

<pre>/home/tux</pre>

<p>
tux can be defined differently at the installation if you don't want to
be called tux! In such a case the path would be: **/home/SomeWhatYouWillBe**.
Both the contents of home, as well as the contents of <em>SomeWhatYouWillBe</em>
can also be contained in a separate partition. The automatic installer
in the SliTaz Panel can help you to do that if you wish. 
</p>

<p>
We can enter now at the prompt our first command: 
</p>

<h3 id="ls">ls</h3>

<p>
<em>You don't need to exit</em>
</p>

<p>
**ls** is a command to list files located in the actual directory.
Adding parameters and/or paths it can do that in each directory where 
you have the rights and can do more than just showing the file names. 
</p>

<p>
Please test:
</p>

<ul>
<li>ls –help</li>
</ul>

<p>
(more? see [here!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ls]).
</p>

<p>
And test now please:
</p>

<ul>
<li>ls /usr/bin</li>
</ul>
