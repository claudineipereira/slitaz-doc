<p>If you'd like to help with the documentation, jump in! Take a look at the 
[Documentation Guidelines|en/guidelines], pick your page and go!
</p>

<p>
There's many areas in which you can help:
</p>

<ul>
<li>**Are you an experienced SliTaz user?**</li>
</ul>

<p>
Go for the [SliTaz Guides|en/guides]. They take users through a process and 
range from customising your desktop to getting networking set-up.
</p>

<ul>
<li>**Are you a general Linux user?**</li>
</ul>

<p>
Take a look at the [SliTaz Handbook|en/guides/handbook]. A lot of general 
introduction to SliTaz, Linux or available software can be written there. 
Some people find it difficult to write technically, others struggle with 
more generically informative writing. Both are needed, in describing the 
topic and scope before brief instructions.
</p>

<ul>
<li>**Are you a non-English speaker?**</li>
</ul>

<p>
Translations are very important to the global audience SliTaz attracts. 
We need speakers of the above languages to ensure non-English readers 
experience better translations than automated services can provide! 
Those are the locales supported by the SliTaz system. We are aiming to 
add more in the future if you can help, please do!

<em>There are more ways to help out with the SliTaz community than 
documentation. If you're interested, everything from artwork to package 
testing would be greatly appreciated! Simply post a quick message to the 
forum or mailing list, or see the [SliTaz Contributors|en/guides/contributor] 
page for how you can get started. Thanks!</em>
